Brush-up course of p5 and programming skills at the start of a new year with Digital Teknik.

The point of this game is to adapt and further develop this template, to make it different than it started out to be.

## My game in MDA function
Mechanics, Dynamics, Aesthetics


### Mechanics
In terms of mechanics (rules, basic components, action), I want to build on my game...

It should be clear to the player that certain fruits give more points than others, using colors.

I want to create side-quests, so that the player can earn bonus-points, which grants the player more purpose and the game becomes more engaging.


### Dynamics
In terms of dynamics (player input), I will build on my game...

The player must be able to grasp the various fruits, and must be able to achieve the side-quests that are made in mechanics. For example, there may be a quest where the player has to grab 3 oranges in a row. Once the player has grabbed 3 oranges, you will get bonus points as a reward.

These side quests should also come up gradually, one should just be able to do 1 quest at a time.

You shouldn't be able to lose if you don't achieve these quests. It's just bonus points if you wish.

You should be able to die from a bomb if you grab it in the basket. 

When you lose too many fruits, you should be able to lose. If you catch enough fruits, you should be able to win. At these screens, you should be able to try again via. a button.


### Aesthetics
In terms of aesthetics (emotional response), I want to build on my game...

1. Sensation (sense-pleasure)

During sense-pleasure, the player must experience sounds when achieving a side quest, when generally gaining a point, and when losing a point. Maybe even background music.

In addition, the visuals must create an experience so that you experience something visually interesting to look at (in relation to background and the whole game).

2. Challenge (obstacle course)

I would also like to add 'bombs', or at least some kind of object that takes a life away from the player (or maybe kills the player altogether). Here you can also make the taste variable itself better in terms of showing which ones give specific points (perhaps in the form of color).
